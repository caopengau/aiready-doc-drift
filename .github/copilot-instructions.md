## Architecture: Hub-and-Spoke Pattern

- **Hubs:** @aiready/core (utilities/types), @aiready/cli (interface)
- **Spokes:** Individual analysis tools importing only from core, integrated via CLI

**Key Rules:**

- Hubs: No spoke dependencies
- Spokes: Import only from core, focus on one problem, comply with CLI specs
- All spokes must integrate with CLI (--output, --include, --exclude, unified format)
- ✅ **Agent Branch Rule:** Agents MUST start work on and target the `main` branch by default. Always confirm with the repository owner before creating or committing to any other branch.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: AWS Credentials & Deployment

**MANDATORY CHECK BEFORE ANY AWS OPERATIONS:**

**AWS Profile:** `AWS_PROFILE=aiready` (defined in makefiles/Makefile.shared.mk)

**⚠️ BEFORE deploying, SST operations, or any AWS commands:**

1. ✅ **ALWAYS verify AWS account first:**
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   # Must show the CORRECT account ID for aiready project
   ```
2. ✅ **ALWAYS check active AWS profile:**
   ```bash
   echo $AWS_PROFILE  # Should be: aiready
   aws configure list
   ```
3. ❌ **NEVER deploy without explicit user confirmation of AWS account**
4. ❌ **NEVER assume AWS credentials are correct**

**If wrong account detected:**

```bash
# Immediately remove deployment:
cd landing && pnpm sst remove --stage production

# Set correct profile:
export AWS_PROFILE=aiready
# OR configure:
aws configure --profile aiready
```

## ⚠️ COMPULSORY: Git Workflow Practices

**CRITICAL:** Before any git operations, **always load and follow** the git workflow sub-instructions:

**Load:** `git-workflow` from doc-mapping.json

**Key Rules (Never Forget):**

- ❌ **NEVER** commit directly to spoke repos
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `make push` after monorepo commits (syncs all spoke repos automatically)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** develop in the monorepo hub
- ✅ **ALWAYS** check `make release-status` before releases

**Workflow:**

```bash
# After changes in monorepo:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
make push  # ← This syncs monorepo + ALL spoke repos automatically
```

## Publishing & Distribution

### Make Commands for Publishing

```bash
make help                    # Show all available commands
make publish-vscode          # Publish VS Code extension (requires VSCE_PAT)
make vscode-publish          # Alias for vscode-publish
make npm-publish SPOKE=core  # Publish individual npm package
make push                    # Push monorepo + sync all spokes to GitHub repos
```

### VS Code Extension

- Location: `vscode-extension/`

- Registries: Smithery, Glama, Pulsar
- Direct: `npx -y @aiready/mcp-server`

## 🚨 MCP Server Maintenance Protocol

When modifying any MCP server (@aiready/mcp-server or @aiready/ast-mcp-server), you **MUST** follow these rules:

1.  **Mandatory Integration Tests**: Every new tool or resource added to an MCP server must have a corresponding integration test in its respective `__tests__` directory.
2.  **Schema Sync**: Ensure that `schemas.ts` (in AST server) or Zod schemas (in core/mcp-server) are perfectly aligned with the implementation.
3.  **Documentation First**: Any change to tool arguments, resource URIs, or prompt names **MUST** be updated in the package's `README.md` immediately.
4.  **Verification**: Always run `make mcp-test` before pushing changes. This ensures both servers and their core dependencies are functional.

## Agent Workflow

1. **Load Context**: Use doc-mapping.json to load relevant sub-instructions based on task. Run `make help` to understand available curated commands.
2. **Work**: Follow architecture rules, check existing implementations for patterns, use Makefiles for all DevOps practices (build, test, push, release).
3. **Verify & Document**: After each change:
    - Update relevant docs in `.github/sub-instructions/` and `doc-mapping.json` if needed.
    - **MCP Special**: Follow the **MCP Server Maintenance Protocol** above for any MCP-related work.
    - Update the project's README or specific package READMEs to reflect new capabilities.
4. **Push**: Use `make push` for monorepo commits to sync all spoke repos automatically.

## Questions for Agent

- Does this belong in core or a spoke?
- Am I creating spoke-to-spoke dependencies?
- Is this tool independently useful?
- Does it overlap existing tools?
- Can I test on a real repo?
- Does it comply with CLI specs?
- Am I updating CLI for new spokes?
- Am I using Makefiles for DevOps tasks instead of direct commands?
- **AWS:** Have I verified AWS account identity with `aws sts get-caller-identity`?
- **AWS:** Is AWS_PROFILE=aiready set correctly?
- **AWS:** Did I get explicit user confirmation before deploying?
- **GIT:** Am I following hub-and-spoke git practices? (Always load git-workflow first!)
- **GIT:** Did I use `make push` instead of direct git commands?
- **GIT:** Is this change in the monorepo or a spoke repo?
- **RELEASE:** After publishing ANY spoke separately, did I republish CLI? (Required!)
- **RELEASE:** Am I excluding landing from release-all? (It has separate workflow)
- **PUBLISH:** For VS Code extension, is VSCE_PAT set in vscode-extension/.env?

## Getting Help

- Reference existing spokes (@aiready/pattern-detect)
- Review core types and CLI interface
- Keep spokes focused on one job
- Use Makefiles for all DevOps practices (see devops-best-practices.md)
- **Web Deployment:** Load `landing-deployment` from doc-mapping.json for Vercel/AWS deployment guides
- **GIT:** Always load `git-workflow` sub-instructions before git operations
- **GIT:** Use `make push` instead of direct git commands
- **Publishing:** Use `make publish-*` commands instead of manual publishing
